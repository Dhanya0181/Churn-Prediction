In the challenge two datasets are given - train.csv and test.csv.

train.csv contains 70% of the overall sample (243,787 subscriptions to be exact) and and reveal whether or 
not the subscription was continued into the next month (the “ground truth”).

The test.csv dataset contains the exact same information about the remaining segment of the overall sample 
(104,480 subscriptions to be exact), but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each subscription. 

Task : Using the patterns you find in the train.csv data, predict whether the subscriptions in test.csv will be
continued for another month, or not.

Submission Format : A dataframe (call it prediction_df with two columns and exactly 104,480 rows (plus a header row). 
The first column should be CustomerID so that we know which prediction belongs to which observation. The second column 
should be called predicted_probability and should be a numeric column representing the likellihood that the subscription 
will churn.

Grading : To determine final score, they compared the predicted_probability predictions to the source of truth 
labels for the observations in test.csv and calculate the ROC AUC.
