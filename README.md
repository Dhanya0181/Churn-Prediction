# Churn-Prediction

Churn prediction is a significant task in the field of data analysis and customer relationship management.
The churn prediction challenge refers to the predictive analysis involved in identifying and forecasting customers 
who are likely to stop using a service, product, or subscription, and ultimately "churn" or leave.

Businesses, particularly those with subscription-based models, telecommunications, software as a service (SaaS), or any service 
with recurring payments, are often interested in reducing customer churn. Predicting and understanding churn patterns can help companies 
take proactive measures to retain customers and maintain business growth.

I have done this as a data science challenge in Coursera. It provided practical experience in utilizing machine learning algorithms and 
data analysis methods to address genuine business concerns.
